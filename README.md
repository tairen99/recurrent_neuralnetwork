# recurrent_neuralnetwork

Languages and packages:  Python, Keras

Try to use recurrent neural network ( LSTM and GRU ) to design a regression model to predict 
day-ahead electrical load demand. The load data is from utility ERCOT at Texas http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/loadprofile. 

This is my first attempt and more detail results and comparison will be uploaded.
